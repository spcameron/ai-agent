# AI Agent

This is the fourth guided project on Boot.dev. The goal is to build a toy version of an agentic AI code editor 
using Google free Gemini API. The program is a CLI tool that accepts a coding task, chooses from a set of pre-
defined functions to work on that task, and loops until the task is complete (or fails miserably).

The learning goals of this project are:
1. Introduce multi-directory python projects
2. Understand how AI tools work under the hood
3. Practice Python and functional programming skills
